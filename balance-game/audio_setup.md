# Balance Game Audio Files

To make this game fully functional, you need to add 8 audio files:

## Track1 folder needs:
- drums.wav (drum track - 30-60 seconds loop)
- vocals.wav (vocal track - same length)
- bass.wav (bass track - same length)  
- others.wav (guitar/keys/etc - same length)

## Track2 folder needs:
- drums.wav (different song - drum track)
- vocals.wav (different song - vocal track)
- bass.wav (different song - bass track)
- others.wav (different song - other instruments)

## Audio Requirements:
- WAV format recommended
- Same sample rate (44.1kHz or 48kHz)
- 30-60 second loops work best
- All stems from same song should be same length
- Mono or stereo both work

The game will work without audio files (silent mode) for testing the interface.
